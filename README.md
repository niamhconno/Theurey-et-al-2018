Code to simulate model and generate data plotted in Figures 1B-D; 2Di,F; 4A


Code created in MATLAB R2017a. 

If there are any issues with this code please contact niamhmconnolly@rcsi.ie


-To generate data for all Figures listed above

--Run Beard_NC_simulatePopulation.m to simulate population of cells

---User input required

---% Line 72: Set number of simulations (currently set to 10)

---% Line 86: Set what experiment to simulate (currently set to 3 = standard Seahorse OCR)

---% Line 96: Set what putative transgenic defects to simulate (all currently set to 1 = wildtype)

--Additionally, a break-point should be set at end of code to extract data

-- Fig 2Di curves can be seen in the Figure 4 automatically generated by code (top graph in 2nd column)


-To explicitly reproduce Fig 1B:

--Run PlotPopulationwLitValues.m


-To explicitly reproduce Figs 1C and 2F

--Copy relevant data from "Pre-generated data (Fig 1c,2F).xlsx" into a variable in MATLAB (called x)

--Run relevant code sections of "plotExptBoxplot.m" (individual sections for each figure)
