Model code and code to reproduce figures

25th January 2018: Paper submitted to Journal of Neuroscience.
Uploaded files are sufficient to run singleRun_checkPopulation.m which will simulate 10 cells and output steady-state values and timeseries compared to experimental data. These simulations were used to generate Figure 1. 

Code created in MATLAB R2017a.

Finalised code will be added here upon article acceptance.
